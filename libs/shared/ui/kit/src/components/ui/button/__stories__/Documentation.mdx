# Button

A button component is used to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an action, or performing a delete operation.

## Basic Usage

The Button component comes with several variants and states that can be used to match the context of your application. Below are some of the most common usages.

### Default Button

The default button is used for primary actions.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Default} />

### Secondary Button

The secondary button is used for secondary actions.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

### Outline Button

The outline button is used when you want a less prominent button that still triggers an action.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Outlined} />

### Destructive Button

The destructive button is used for actions that are potentially harmful, such as deleting data.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Destructive} />

### Ghost Button

The ghost button is used for actions that are less prominent than the default and secondary button variants.
