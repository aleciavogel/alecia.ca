This is the source code for my personal website, [alecia.ca](https://alecia.ca). I'm making this project open-source
so that others can learn from it, I can receive feedback, and so that potential clients can see my work.

As a bonus, it powers my blog's comment sections via GitHub Discussions. ðŸ˜„

  <summary>Extra note for WebStorm users RE: memory</summary>

  YMMV, but you will likely need to 
  [increase WebStorm's memory heap](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/how-to-improve-product-performance.html#ws_improve_performance_increase_memory_heap_via_ide) 
  to 4096MiB. 
  The default memory heap wasn't enough for me to run this on my own machine.
